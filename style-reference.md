### Design Principles

**Warm**: We want people to visit ChefUp and feel a sense of community and be excited to start cooking home made meals <br />
**Visual**: there will be lots of photos of food and ProfilePage photos to encourage trust and enthuse people to use the app <br />
**Consistency**: this style guide aims to show how we wil provide consistency through out the app, with colour, sizing, text and more <br />
**Don't reinvent the wheel** - we want to take inspiration from other products and how for example they display a map - people who regularly use these products are familiar with a certain functionality and we want to emulate that <br />


### Design choices throughout app

**Accessibility** - at the forefront of all design choices  <br />
**Icons** - using recognisable icons for 'home' 'search' and where it is not recognisable, adding text  <br />
**Mobile-first Design**  <br />
**Navigation** - ability to guide through the app as the user wishes, going back and forth easily so the user is able to check over information.  <br />
**Language** - plain and simple communication.  <br />
**Authentication** - when a user is authenticated they will be able to book and add lessons otherwise, they will be requested to login/register  <br />
